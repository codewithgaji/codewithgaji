## 🧠 How I Build Software

I focus on **problem-solving, system design, and backend-first development**.

Most of my projects are built with a **backend-first mindset**:
- I design and implement APIs myself (Django, FastAPI)
- I handle data modeling, business logic, and endpoint design
- I ensure clean integration between backend services and frontends

When frontend collaborators are unavailable, I take **full ownership of delivery** by:
- leveraging **AI-assisted development tools** to accelerate UI development
- integrating frontend components directly with my APIs
- debugging, testing, deploying, and maintaining complete systems

My goal is not to manually do every single thing, but to **ship reliable, working software efficiently**, using the right tools, patterns, and engineering judgment.

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I enjoy working on **backend systems, APIs, infrastructure, and developer tools**, and I’m always open to:
- collaborations
- learning opportunities
- open-source contributions

I believe great engineers are defined by their ability to **adapt, learn quickly, and ship solutions**, not by avoiding tools that make them more effective.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you’d like to collaborate! 🙌
